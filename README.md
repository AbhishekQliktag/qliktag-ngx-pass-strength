# AngularLibs - Password Strength Meter

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## NGX-Pass-Strength

This is the home for my Angular library which checks the password strength plus verifies it against Have I Been Pawned APIs to see if this password has been found in a breach or not.
